# Frazier's GIS Portfolio
I am a student at Colorado Mountain College - Leadville and I am pursuing a GIS Certification. I have used maps extensively in while guiding outdoor adventures and exploring our natural world. Now I look forward to honing my skills in digital map production and analysis. This is a collection of my GIS work so far!
