# Frazier's GIS Portfolio
I am a student at Colorado Mountain College - Leadville and I am pursuing a GIS Certification. I have used maps extensively in while guiding outdoor adventures and exploring our natural world. Now I look forward to honing my skills in digital map production and analysis. This is a collection of my GIS work so far!

## Leadville's East Side Snowmobile Trails - Birdseye Gulch Access
This map details the snowmobile tour routes used by High Country Tours. These trail networks are available to the public for motorized and non-motorized use. This resource is not intended to serve as a comprehensive map of the trail system and is not to be relied upon to mitigate avalanche danger or other hazards in and around these trails.
